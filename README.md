# Outcast App

Disenfranchised and oppressed communities have been systemically barred from sharing our thoughts and opinions with the ruling class for much of history. In response to this, we began organizing spaces to express our innermost feelings and communicate our innermost thoughts to others without fear of retaliation or suppression. I created Outcast, a Sinatra web application, to be an online space through which users can post their thoughts and opinions (regardless of how random they may be) on a number of personal and societal issues. This was inspired by Twitter and Reddit!
